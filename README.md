Minecraft Setup and Managing Script Suite

Make sure you have installed Java 17.

Unzip the files.

Then run:
./install_server

That's it. The install will guide you the rest of the way.

Then to manage run the manage_server file in your main minecraft server directory (where the server.jar is) like so:
./manage_server
